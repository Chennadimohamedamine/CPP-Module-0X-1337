📦 42 C++ Modules
A full walk-through of the C++ modules (00 → 09) from the 42 Network.
This series deepens object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in C++ through a variety of increasingly complex projects.

📘 Overview
These modules explore C++ syntax, concepts, and advanced programming paradigms. The goal is to transition from C procedural thinking to C++'s OOP mindset using classes, inheritance, polymorphism, templates, STL, and more.

Each module includes mandatory exercises, often with bonus tasks, and must be compiled using strict flags (-Wall -Wextra -Werror -std=c++98).

🧩 Modules Breakdown
🧱 Module 00 – Basics of C++
Introduction to C++ syntax and structure

Working with classes and member functions

Constructors and destructors

Private vs public attributes

🔑 Key concept: Get comfortable using classes and object instantiation.

⚙️ Module 01 – Memory and References
Dynamic memory allocation in C++

new / delete

References vs pointers

File streams (ifstream, ofstream)

Class methods and I/O handling

🔑 Key concept: Understand memory handling and references in OOP.

📦 Module 02 – Ad-hoc Polymorphism (Overloading)
Operator overloading

Function overloading

Static members

Nested classes

🔑 Key concept: Customize behaviors using overloaded operators/functions.

🧬 Module 03 – Inheritance
Single inheritance

Using protected and public inheritance

Base class vs derived class relationships

🔑 Key concept: Create hierarchies and share behavior between classes.

🧠 Module 04 – Polymorphism (Runtime)
Abstract classes

Virtual functions and overrides

Pure virtual functions

Interfaces

🔑 Key concept: Use dynamic dispatch and understand the power of runtime polymorphism.

🧰 Module 05 – Exceptions
Exception handling in C++ (try, catch, throw)

Creating custom exception classes

Proper error management

🔑 Key concept: Safe and clean error handling with custom exceptions.

🗃️ Module 06 – Casts
static_cast, dynamic_cast, const_cast, and reinterpret_cast

Downcasting and upcasting

Safe casting between classes

🔑 Key concept: Master type conversions and avoid undefined behavior.

⚖️ Module 07 – Templates
Function and class templates

Template specialization

Code generalization and reusability

🔑 Key concept: Write generic, type-safe code using templates.

📚 Module 08 – STL (Standard Template Library)
Use of common STL containers: vector, stack, map

Iterators, algorithms

Real-life use of templates in the STL

🔑 Key concept: Learn and apply efficient data structures and algorithms with STL.

🚀 Module 09 – Function Pointers & Callbacks
Function pointers and functors

Lambdas (optional)

Callback systems

Command pattern logic

🔑 Key concept: Implement flexible behaviors using function pointers or function objects.

🧠 What I Learned
Strong foundation in OOP, polymorphism, memory management

How to write clean and reusable C++98-compliant code

Advanced concepts like casting, STL, templates

Designing and organizing scalable C++ programs

💡 Tips
If you're new to these modules:

Stick to the canonical form: constructor, destructor, copy constructor, assignment operator.

Practice understanding deep vs shallow copies.

Use Valgrind to ensure no memory leaks.
