## ðŸ“˜ Overview

These modules explore C++ syntax, concepts, and advanced programming paradigms. The goal is to transition from C procedural thinking to C++'s OOP mindset using classes, inheritance, polymorphism, templates, STL, and more.

Each module includes mandatory exercises, often with bonus tasks, and must be compiled using strict flags:  
```bash
-Wall -Wextra -Werror -std=c++98
