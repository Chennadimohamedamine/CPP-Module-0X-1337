# 📦 42 C++ Modules

> A full walk-through of the **C++ modules (00 → 09)** from the 42 Network.  
> This series deepens object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in C++ through a variety of increasingly complex projects.

---

## 📘 Overview

These modules explore C++ syntax, concepts, and advanced programming paradigms. The goal is to transition from C procedural thinking to C++'s OOP mindset using classes, inheritance, polymorphism, templates, STL, and more.

Each module includes mandatory exercises, often with bonus tasks, and must be compiled using strict flags:  
```bash
-Wall -Wextra -Werror -std=c++98
```

## 🧩 Modules Breakdown

---

### 🧱 Module 00 – Basics of C++

- Introduction to C++ syntax and structure  
- Working with classes and member functions  
- Constructors and destructors  
- Private vs public attributes  

> 🔑 **Key concept**: Get comfortable using classes and object instantiation.

---

### ⚙️ Module 01 – Memory and References

- Dynamic memory allocation in C++  
- `new` / `delete`  
- References vs pointers  
- File streams (`ifstream`, `ofstream`)  
- Class methods and I/O handling  

> 🔑 **Key concept**: Understand memory handling and references in OOP.

---

### 📦 Module 02 – Ad-hoc Polymorphism (Overloading)

- Operator overloading  
- Function overloading  
- Static members  
- Nested classes  

> 🔑 **Key concept**: Customize behaviors using overloaded operators/functions.

---

### 🧬 Module 03 – Inheritance

- Single inheritance  
- Using `protected` and `public` inheritance  
- Base class vs derived class relationships  

> 🔑 **Key concept**: Create hierarchies and share behavior between classes.

---

### 🧠 Module 04 – Polymorphism (Runtime)

- Abstract classes  
- Virtual functions and overrides  
- Pure virtual functions  
- Interfaces  

> 🔑 **Key concept**: Use dynamic dispatch and understand the power of runtime polymorphism.

---

### 🧰 Module 05 – Exceptions

- Exception handling in C++ (`try`, `catch`, `throw`)  
- Creating custom exception classes  
- Proper error management  

> 🔑 **Key concept**: Safe and clean error handling with custom exceptions.

---

### 🗃️ Module 06 – Casts

- `static_cast`, `dynamic_cast`, `const_cast`, and `reinterpret_cast`  
- Downcasting and upcasting  
- Safe casting between classes  

> 🔑 **Key concept**: Master type conversions and avoid undefined behavior.

---

### ⚖️ Module 07 – Templates

- Function and class templates  
- Template specialization  
- Code generalization and reusability  

> 🔑 **Key concept**: Write generic, type-safe code using templates.

---

### 📚 Module 08 – STL (Standard Template Library)

- Use of common STL containers: `vector`, `stack`, `map`  
- Iterators, algorithms  
- Real-life use of templates in the STL  

> 🔑 **Key concept**: Learn and apply efficient data structures and algorithms with STL.

---

### 🚀 Module 09 – Function Pointers & Callbacks

- Function pointers and functors  
- Lambdas (optional)  
- Callback systems  
- Command pattern logic  

> 🔑 **Key concept**: Implement flexible behaviors using function pointers or function objects.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Strong foundation in **OOP**, **polymorphism**, **memory management**  
- How to write clean and reusable **C++98-compliant** code  
- Advanced concepts like **casting**, **STL**, **templates**  
- Designing and organizing scalable C++ programs

---

## 💡 Tips

If you're new to these modules:

- Stick to the **canonical form**: constructor, destructor, copy constructor, assignment operator  
- Practice understanding **deep vs shallow copies**  
- Use **Valgrind** to ensure no memory leaks
